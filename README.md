# Burn-Area-Mapping-and-Fire-Spread-Potential-Modeling-Using-SAR-and-Open-Data
This project is a lightweight prototype to create SAR-based wildfire monitoring products. It demonstrates how Sentinel-1 data can be used to map burned areas and generate an initial fire spread potential model using open environmental data.
